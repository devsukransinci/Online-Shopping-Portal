As a business owner in the e-commerce sector, I am currently operating without the aid of any digital solutions.
My product line consists of a variety of items, each identified by a unique code and accompanied by a detailed description.

Customers interact with my business by placing orders from this list of products.
I identify my customers using their first name, last name, email and address.
Each customer transaction involves a specific payment method.
Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction, I take the responsibility to inform the customer via an email, confirming
the success of their payment or conversely, notifying them of any payment failures.

In a bid to streamline operations and promote growth within my business, I am looking to invest in the development of a dedicated application.
This application will serve to simplify my business processes and contribute significantly to the overall efficiency and scalability of my online venture.
